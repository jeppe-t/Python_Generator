#Generator

#Generator: Iterator, en vÃ¦rdi af gangen, less memory consumption

"""

A generator is a simplified way to write an iterator, that gives us some advantages. Usually a list is iterated through
in a way, so we can only access the values once the whole list is iterated. Imagine if we had 5 millions customer, that
we needed to update with something. We could run out of memory if we needed the complete list before updating.

Or imagine a loading bar, where we need to update the user in the process how many procent is loaded, then we want one
value at a time.

A generator takes care of that, by allowing us to access one value at a time.

#Example 1 (Generator using yield)

# Using the keyword yield makes it a generator
# Yield has the dunder-methods __iter__ and __next__ implemented
# Yield furthermore suspend the functions execution and sends the value back to the caller
# It will hold the state in memory, but do not save the value.
